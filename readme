Bone Density Classification with EfficientNet-B3

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for bone density classification using EfficientNet-B3.
The model classifies medical images into three categories:

1) Normal

2) Osteopenia

3) Osteoporosis

The implementation leverages PyTorch, timm, Albumentations, and advanced training strategies such as label smoothing, oversampling, cosine annealing scheduler, and Test Time Augmentation (TTA) to achieve robust performance.
